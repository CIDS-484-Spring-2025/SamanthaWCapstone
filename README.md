Project Description: Titled "Stewart Learns To Code", this project is a visual novel style coding education game where you play as the character Stewart, who has decided he wants to learn how to code and needs your help to do so. Gameplay consists of stages/lessons where a basic coding concept will be taught and then various questions will be asked that related to it. Get all of a stage’s questions correct and you will be rewarded with a collectible that will be equipped onto Stewart. The ending will differ depending on how many questions you got correct. Game is intended for those who have no coding experience.
