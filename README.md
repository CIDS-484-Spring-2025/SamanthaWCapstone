Project Description: Titled "Stewart Learns To Code", this project is a visual novel style coding education game where you play as the character Stewart, who has decided he wants to learn how to code and needs your help to do so. Gameplay consists of various stages/lessons where a basic coding concept will be taught and then various questions will be asked that related to it. Get all of a stageâ€™s questions correct and you will be rewarded with a collectible which can then be equipped onto Stewart. The ending of the story will differ depending on how many questions you got correct.

Current Progress: Prototype Complete, working on first lesson
